This repository is a special repository. It contains my first large scale web development project.
The project is a blog template built with the following basic web development tools:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 4
4. Jquery too for only bootstrap.
You can see the project live as i build on by following this link - (https://okpainmo.github.io)

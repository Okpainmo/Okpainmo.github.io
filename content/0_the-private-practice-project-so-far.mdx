The 'Private Practice' project, is a client project that the team at Zed Labs is currently working on.

> We recently delivered
> The King Of Pi Mall project - An awesome e-commerce platform with payments powered by the Pi Network token/cryptocurrency(Pi) to another client.
> [Follow this link to read the story](https://blog.zedlabs.xyz/project-stories/how-we-built-the-king-of-pi-mall-blockchain-ecommerce-project)
> of how we built that project into an awesome masterpiece.

The current 'Practice Project' as it is called, is a beautiful project that is set to make impact in a niche market/domain within The
Nigerian tech space. Even though not without challenges(just like in every other project), We are Zed Labs are
excited about being a part of it.

> This blog-post is a beautiful story of how we're currently progressing on the project.

As you might have noticed, I'm unfortunately not able to share deeper details about the project. This is due to
our binding commitment to ethical standards that are to be kept on client projects that are still in progress. While this article
does not share much details about the project, it dives into very interesting details about the project. Chronicling
our professionalism, expertise, and culture at Zed Labs. I do hope you find it very interesting.

## What the client wanted.

Our understanding of what the client wanted was clear. As a matter fact, the project was one with a lot of planning and some work already
put in place. So it was one we could easily handle. But there is still an initial back story...

## An Initial Back-Story.

Similar to the other client project we delivered, this project also had some progress prior to Zed Labs. The project
was however facing a number of challenges, which we're having to fix up in our bid to make another outstanding delivery.

> Two of our project so far at Zed Labs have been client projects that faced issues/roadblocks - before 
> the clients contacted us - issues which we had(and continue) to undo in our efforts to deliver awesome masterpieces. 
> 
> Hiring quality talents remains a global issue. We can help you solve that at Zed Labs
> by handling your hiring processes and connecting you with top talents from all around the world.

## Tech Stack Used.

As usual, all our project at Zed Labs are built with state-of-the-art technologies. We're intentional about only giving
our clients the best for their money. It means a lot that they entrusted us with delivering their projects.

The core project build consists of two stand-alone front-end apps, and a backend.

### 1. The Front-end.

The project's frontends are being built using ReactJs and NextJs with - TailwindCSS for styling. This combination remains our
default choices for front-end development at Zed Labs. State management is currently being handled with Redux-ToolKit -
with Axios for data fetching. We hope to bring on SWR as well to enhance data fetching - especially for better data-revalidation
handling.

> Once and again, I'll honestly add that SWR seems to be quite underrated - just my humble opinion though.
>
> Don't know SWR? - [explore it here](https://swr.vercel.app)

Headless UI is our preferred UI Library. It's simple and perfect with just enough components to help us fast-track UI development in some areas.

### 2. The Backend.

The Backend is being handled with NodeJs/ExpressJs - my preferred stack for backend development(when stuffed with Typescript of course) prior
to meeting Python(Django - with the Django ninja framework) 🤓.

Node/Express fits perfectly well - since we got on the project with some initial progress. It only makes sense
to stick with the current stack to enable us deliver faster - with only necessary overhauls in needful areas/instances.

### 3. Cloud/Infra and Deployments.

For cloud service, AWS remains our go-to choice at Zed Labs. Everything so far is currently being handled on AWS -
from front-end deployments, to file storage, to EC2 VM(s), and more. However, the Database in this case is MongoDB.

> I plan to write an article shortly on why we prefer to use AWS as our cloud service provider at Zed Labs. Keep an eye on
> the Zed Labs blog just so you don't miss out when the post is released.

### 3. Payment Integration.

For payment integration, we hope to use Paystack. Just in case you don't know Paystack, Paystack is a stripe company, that has
been making massive strides in the African payment/fin-tech space.

## The Zed Labs Team And The Process.

Every project with our awesome team of 3 'marines' is beautiful. I must however confess, that it's been quite challenging
thanks to being a new software and design agency that is currently striving to make it's mark.

As usual, I lead the development of the front-end, with support from our awesome junior front-end developer Powell Ikechukwu - a
simple soul that I'm deeply glad to have as a partner.

I'm currently the sole engineer on the backend of the project while handling all cloud administrative chores and a lot more.

I am also responsible for making all system design, architectural and DevOps decisions on the project as it stands.

Once again, I must appreciate the efforts of our our COO(Mrs Ikani Ojecho), we're grateful for how much she comes through for us
in all our projects.

## Where we are at currently.

After all the work to this point, we're at a very crucial stage of the project. We hope to get done with it in under one month from now.
We'll do well to share another beautiful story once that's done.

> We do believe you love reading our project stories. We hope they inspire you and help you become better - especially if you're

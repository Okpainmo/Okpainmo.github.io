The King Of Pi(KOP) mall project was a very interesting one for us at Zed Labs. Being one of our first client projects - as a new software development
and design agency, we did all we could to deliver a masterpiece. The result was a beautiful end-product that speaks for itself - just as 
will be seen in some selected screenshots that will be shared below.

The project is an e-commerce platform with payments powered by the Pi Network/Blockchain token - The Pi Token/cryptocurrency.

This blog-post is a beautiful story of how it worked out.

## What the client wanted.

Our client was very clear with what he wanted from the off-set. Being an ardent believer of the Pi Network/Blockchain,
he intended to build a mall on which Pi-holding users(Pioneer - as they are called), can shop/buy items using the Pi cryptocurrency from
anywhere in the world. He wanted a project with a global-scope - which was all possible thanks to the power and universality of
blockchain/cryptocurrency payments.

## An Initial Back-Story.

Prior to connecting with Zed Labs, the client complained of how much previous losses he had incurred, and the challenges he
faced in the hands of previous teams that he contracted with delivering the project.

> As a matter of fact, We took over the project with some initial progress. But due to some issues - especially the quality of the 
> code/software, we had to scrap out most of what was handed over. 
>
> All the transferred code/software(everything including the front-end and the backend) was scrapped and built 
> from scratch by us.
>
> Only some parts of the originally delivered UI/UX design was used as delivered. The UI/UX interfaces received massive 
> enhancements unlike on the design that was handed over to us.

## Tech Stack Used.

The project build is a world-class one. We ensured to deliver with top and trending software development technologies.

### 1. The Front-end.

The project's front-end was build with ReactJs(NextJs) - with TailwindCSS for styling. We handled the state management which was of
course a complex one using ReduxToolKit - with Axios and SWR helping with data fetching and revalidation.

> [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) honestly seems to be very very underrated.
>
> SWR, built by [Vercel](https://vercel.com), is a React data-fetching library that provides fast, real-time updates by showing cached data first, while 
> being able to perform some powerful revalidation in the background. 

We also made use of Headless UI for simplifying and fast-tracking the development of some UI sections. 

Of course as you would expect, there was a lot more work on the frontend that can't be covered in detail in this article.

### 2. The Backend.

The Backend was built with Python(Django - the Django Ninja Framework). This choice turned out perfect thanks to how much speed and quality the Django framework gave us with so much less work. For Database,
PostgreSQL was a great choice - so we used it as our primary database.

### 3. Cloud/Infra and Deployments.

For cloud service, we stuck with AWS. AWS remains our go-to choice at Zed Labs. Everything(for both the staging and
production environments) was handled gracefully on AWS - from front-end deployments, to file storage,
to database provisioning and management, and more.

### 3. Blockchain Integration.

Blockchain integrations are no mean chores. They demand some considerable level of expertise. That was no problem to us
at Zed Labs, we know our stuff, and we handled this one gracefully. Thanks to the use of the Pi SDK(s) as provided by the Pi-core team,
we had less worries about security. The Pi authentication and payment integrations were all successful.

## The Zed Labs Team And The Process.

Delivering the project as a lean team of just 3, was challenging, but worth the adventure.

I Led the development of the front-end, of course with phenomenal support from our junior front-end developer Powell Ikechukwu - which I
mentored all through the project. Powell Deserves his flowers on this one - he was awesome.

I solo-engineered the massive backend of the project while handling all cloud administrative chores and a lot more. 

As the CTO of a lean software and design agency, wearing many hats is simply part of my role. Being the generalist that I am, I must confess that
I love every process of it all. Just that is can get overwhelming sometimes.

I was also responsible for making all system design, architectural and DevOps decisions on the project. Finally, I was responsible for managing all
deployments across both the staging and productions environments.

> Aside just engineering and code, I crafted and coordinated over half(50%) of the UI/UX design implementation of the whole project.

Big shout-out to Ikani Ojecho - our COO, for how much she came through for us all through the project.

## What we delivered.

After a massive amount of work, we successfully delivered a beautiful fully-responsive(device adaptive) product - with 2
awesome-looking front-end interfaces(one for the users, and the other for administrative chores).

The platform was launched on the 3rd March 2025 at the Swiss International Hotel,
Victoria Garden City(VGC), Lagos Nigeria.

> So far, the KOP Mall platform has recorded more than 2200 new user registrations, and over 
> 1400 Pi(more than 1 million Nigerian Naira) in blockchain payments on the Pi Network Mainnet - all in less than 30 days.

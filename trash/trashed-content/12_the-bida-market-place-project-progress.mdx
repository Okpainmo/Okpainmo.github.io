The **Bida Marketplace Project** is one of our most exciting ongoing builds at **Zed Labs** — a digital platform designed to connect buyers, sellers, and service providers in one trusted hub.

Unlike traditional e-commerce websites that only focus on products, Bida Marketplace goes a step further: it brings together trade **and services**, while positioning itself as the reliable middleman between buyers and sellers.

> Just like we did with projects such as the **King Of Pi Mall**, we’re committed to building Bida Marketplace into more than just another website — but into a **platform that simplifies trust, commerce, and everyday transactions** for people and businesses.

This blog post shares the journey so far — the vision behind Bida Marketplace, our process at Zed Labs, the technologies powering the platform, and how we’re overcoming challenges to bring this project to life.

## The Bida Market Place Project — Progress Update

When we first set out to build the **Bida Market Place**, our vision was simple:  
create a digital and physical hub where traders, buyers, and the wider community could connect seamlessly.

Bida, being a commercial center in Niger State, has always had vibrant trade activity. But the marketplace model was outdated — limited reach, manual record-keeping, and no digital integration. That’s what sparked this initiative.

---

## Back-Story

The project started as a small idea within our team discussions in February 2025 .  
We wanted to explore **how technology could support local economies**, not just in Lagos or Abuja, but in smaller, trade-driven cities like Bida.

By March 2025, we had our first concept:

- A **marketplace management system** for vendors to upload products.
- A **community-facing app** for buyers to explore goods and services.
- Tools for **inventory, payments, and logistics integration**.

The initial design drew heavily from conversations with traders in Bida. Their feedback was clear:  
simplicity, reliability, and affordability would determine whether this project would succeed.

## Tech Stack Used

As with all our projects, we’re intentional about the technologies we choose. For Bida Marketplace, the stack is designed to combine **speed, scalability, and trustworthiness**.

### 1. The Frontend

The frontend is being built with:

- **ReactJS & Next.js** → for performance and scalability.
- **TailwindCSS** → for modern, fast, and responsive UI.
- **Redux Toolkit** → to manage complex state across buyers, sellers, and services.
- **Axios** → for clean and efficient data fetching.

We’ve kept the design minimal but powerful, ensuring users have a seamless shopping and service-booking experience.

### 2. The Backend

The backend is powered by:

- **Node.js & Express.js** → with **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **MongoDB** → handling structured and unstructured data for products, services, and users.
- **PostgreSQL** → handling relational user data (authentication, authorization, profiles, roles).
- **Authentication & Authorization** → secure logins with JWT, with room for future integration of social sign-ins.

### 3. Payments

Payments are a core part of Bida Marketplace. From the start, the vision was to support **both fiat and crypto**:

- **Fiat currency** for everyday transactions.
- **Stablecoins (like USDT)** for users who prefer crypto.

This flexibility gives users trust and choice, while positioning the marketplace for global scalability.

### 4. Cloud & Infrastructure

As always, **AWS** is our cloud provider of choice. The project uses:

- **S3** for media and file storage.
- **EC2** for server hosting.
- **CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging.
- **CI/CD pipelines** to ensure faster, reliable deployments.

## The Zed Labs Team and Process

Bida Marketplace has been both exciting and challenging for our team. With a small but efficient squad of engineers and designers, we’ve been able to move fast without sacrificing quality.

- **Frontend development** is led by myself, with support from our junior frontend developer Powell Ikechukwu.
- **Backend, cloud, and DevOps** are handled by me directly, ensuring the architecture is clean and scalable.
- **Product oversight** is done in collaboration with our COO, Mrs. Ikani Ojecho, ensuring we never lose sight of user experience.

Every step has been deliberate — from UI wireframes to database design, we’re building for both **today’s needs** and **tomorrow’s growth**.

---

## Where We Are At Currently

Right now, the project is in the **designing and integration phase for the frontend** while at the same time **creating backend endpoints** for both the **admin dashboard** and the **main marketplace app**.

- Frontend is being wired up to the backend API.
- Admin panel endpoints for user management and marketplace moderation are under development.
- Main app endpoints for listings, search, and transactions are being refined.

We expect this stage to give us a solid baseline where both apps (admin + main) communicate seamlessly with the backend.

> Like every project at Zed Labs, the journey has its fair share of challenges, but our drive to build meaningful software keeps us moving forward.
